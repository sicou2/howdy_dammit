The Colors of a Flag for the Stars

NROYGBIVM are some colors
Not all of them
More than can be seen
Some of them
Life is incomplete
Even when you fill more

A new color discovery 
When we add to the world
Others can have more
It will still be unfinished

When you find hope run
You will learn
Look to things greater 
Look to things different
