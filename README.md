Perfection and procrastination have been a killer. They are a positive feedback loop that I must master. I will finish LPtHW before the end of 2019. Apathy that had developed to be my armor against failure myst be replaced by something else. If I fail, it does not matter. I didn't really try. I must get healthy and establish realistic goals for fitness. I will continue to learn.
